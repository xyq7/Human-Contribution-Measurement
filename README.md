## Overview
With the growing prevalence of generative artificial intelligence (AI), an increasing amount of content is no longer exclusively generated by humans but by generative AI models with human guidance.
This shift presents notable challenges for the delineation of originality due to the varying degrees of human contribution in AI-assisted works.
This study raises the research question of measuring human contribution in AI-assisted content generation and introduces a framework to address this question that is grounded in information theory. 
By calculating  mutual information between human input and AI-assisted output relative to self-information of AI-assisted output, we quantify the proportional information contribution of humans in content generation.
Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed measure effectively discriminates between varying degrees of human contribution across multiple creative domains.
We hope that this work lays a foundation for measuring human contributions in AI-assisted content generation in the era of generative AI.

A standard computer with a stable and reliable internet connection is required to access the OpenAI API.

The package has been tested on a machine with the following specifications:

* Memory: 216GB
* Processor: AMD EPYC 7V13 64-Core Processor

### Software Requirement

The package has been tested and verified to work on 

* Linux: Ubuntu 22.04.

It is recommended to use this operating system for optimal compatibility.

Before installing the required Python dependencies and running the source code, ensure that you have the following software installed:

## Installation Guide

### Requirements
We use docker to manage the experimental enviroments. Pull the following docker image to your local devices.
```bash
docker pull yjw1029/torch:2.0-llm-v9
```

For experiments with Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, fastchat is need to be reinstalled:
```bash
pip uninstall -y -q fschat
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat
```

For experiments with Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1, fastchat is need to be reinstalled:
```bash
pip install vllm==0.2.7
```

Since this package requires access to the OpenAI API, you will need to register an account and obtain your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Please follow the instructions provided in the OpenAI documentation for registration and obtaining the API keys: [OpenAI Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction).
The code has been test with OpenAI Services.
Setup the your OpenAI API key in `src/config/gpt35.yaml`.

We also conduct experiments with Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1. Please apply for LLAMA-3 access on the [official meta website](https://llama.meta.com/llama-downloads/) and the [huggingface repo](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct). Then set your huggingface access token before running experiments.

```bash
export HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=[Your Hugging Face Token]
```
